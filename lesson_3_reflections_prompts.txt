When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
      When I am collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	To limit the number of commits, or updates to files. To ensure I pull only after    
         logical changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- A fork is produced only on Github when I copy someone else's repository. Used if I want access to another repository without changing the original.

- A clone is produced by coping a repository from Github to a local machine. Used when I want to make changes to the repository, on my machine, not on Github.

- A branch is a pointer from a master branch onto which there are a series of commits. Used when I need to experiment with changes to a master branch without affect the master itself. A some point the branch can be merged with the master.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    It helps to keep track of previous state on the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    I would use emails to transfer files. it would be harder since I would have to write detailed information about changes. Github finds changes automatically.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

     The master contains the main project. All other branches are development and testing branches. So it is safer to make changes in a separate branch, test then to make sure they are okay before merging into the master branch.
