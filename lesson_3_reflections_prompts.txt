When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
      When I am collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	To limit the number of commits, or updates to files. To ensure I pull only after    
         logical changes.
