When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
      When I am collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	To limit the number of commits, or updates to files. To ensure I pull only after    
         logical changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- A fork is produced only on Github when I copy someone else's repository. Used if I want access to another repository without changing the original.

- A clone is produced by coping a repository from Github to a local machine. Used when I want to make changes to the repository, on my machine, not on Github.

- A branch is a pointer from a master branch onto which there are a series of commits. Used when I need to experiment with changes to a master branch without affect the master itself. A some point the branch can be merged with the master.
